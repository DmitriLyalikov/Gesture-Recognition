## Introduction 
This project is a gesture recognition application based on STM32. The project is designed to recognize gestures using the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors on the STM32. The project is implemented using the DISCO_F429ZI board and the Mbed Framework. The project is designed to learn gestures on user request, and lock or unlock a system based on correct comparison of a new gesture to the learned gestures.
